title: "LLM for the Best WSB Moves"

## WSB Bot

### Motivation
For a fun project, I think it would be interesting to train an LLM model that would take in data from the r/wallstreetbets subreddit by going through posts that mention tags of yolo and loss to formulate a prediction of "THE BEST" move for the next day. Currently, models that take text as input perform much better than models that use images like ViT. The goal of this project is to create a model that behaves closely to wallstreetbet users to help understand user behavior. This is more of a passion project to help myself learn more about LLMs and to create something fun. It would be interesting if I am able to find ways to make this model more efficient by using my background in reinforcement learning to attempt to increase the accuracy of its behavior. By behavior I mean wallstreetbets community language. This is not scientific as there will be no baselines as there are no ground truths and the behavior of wallstreetbets users cannot be defined. The definition of success is for the response of the bot to output a response similar to one of the YOLOs and make it funny. This page will be dedicated to documenting my progress.

Creative problem solving (CPS) is a process through
which an agent discovers previously unknown information about
itself and its environment in order to achieve an unsolvable
task. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for
CPS through action discovery. We describe two methods which
enable action discovery at a declarative and neurosymbolic level,
namely through action primitive segmentation, and behavior
babbling, respectively. We review experimental evaluations of our
framework, and end with a discussion on limitations and future
work considerations for CPS.

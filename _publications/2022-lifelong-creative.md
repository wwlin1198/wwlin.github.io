Creative problem solving (CPS) is a skill which enables
innovation, often times through repeated exploration of
an agentâ€™s world. In this work, we investigate methods
for life-long creative problem solving (LLCPS), with
the goal of increasing CPS capability over time. We de-
velop two world models to facilitate LLCPS which use
sub-symbolic action and object information to predict
symbolic meta-outcomes of actions. We experiment
with three CPS scenarios run sequentially and in sim-
ulation. Results suggest that LLCPS is possible through
the use of a world model, which can be trained on CPS
exploration trials, and used to guide future CPS explo-
ration.

## Using the Turtlebot2 Robot in ROS Melodic

This is to document how I setup and ran the turtlebot2 with ROS Melodic (18.04). I was still using ROS1 but I will include ROS2 but it will be the same as the github that I have found. 

PLEASE HAVE FETCH CONNECTED THROUGH ETHERNET IF BASE IS NOT NEEDED AS IT LOSES CONNECTION IF IT IS ON WIFI IF NOT ACTIVELY USED DURING DEVELOPMENT

### Turtlebot2 Setup

#### Preliminaries
Before we start, make sure that all the workstations and robots have their own static IPs. If static IP is not implemented, please implement it using a separate router. Donâ€™t use a school's static IP as it provides unstable Connection. If you are running multi-robot setup on ROS1, please use run the command: export ROBOT_NAME. 

#### Installing Packages
